#### TASKS

* You are playing the role of the entrepreneur and your task is to provide a feedback to the groups.
* You may comment fonts and colours, etc. used within creating the websites.
* Be honest but tolerant. Be supportive but also critical enough. Remember, students are not professional web designers, anyway, they want to learn the basics properly as much as possible.
* Do that in the middle of their working plan, not at the end, so they will have time to discuss and make possible changes.
* Check their work in progress on [http://fec.spselitdobruska.cz/](http://fec.spselitdobruska.cz/)
