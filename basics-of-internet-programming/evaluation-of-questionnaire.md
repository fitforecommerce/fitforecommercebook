## Evaluation of results and conclusion

#### _**General information:**_

At the beginning and at the end of the week the students had to answer a questionnaire with the same questions so that the evaluation of the questionnaire afterwards would show developments and changes attitudes, knowledges and skills gained by the students during the week.

Students from Germany and Italy did not have any basics of Internet programming as you can see from the results of the questionnaire, so we based the whole week on a basic level, so everyone could learn something from this field. The students from the Czech Republic mostly played the role of more skilled members of the teams \(However, there were some Czech students with just some basic knowledge of programming, not so advanced, so they learnt a lot of technical features as well.\), so they could help with any trouble concerning coding. However, in teams the strategy was divided as well as subtasks, so everyone could find some interest, mostly in the area of design which could foster anyone to join other fields of programming.

There are values of each questions had to be answered:

| Answer | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| "I totally disagree." | Value 1 |
| "I disagree." | Value 2 |
| "I agree." | Value 3 |
| "I totally agree." | Value 4 |

In the following questionnaire you can find the average value of answers at the beginning and at the end of the week:
